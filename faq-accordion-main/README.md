## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Flex
- Mobile-first workflow
- Vanilla JS

### What I learned

I would like to recap some of the key learnings from this project, which include:

- Utilizing CSS flexbox to arrange related elements on a webpage.
- Understanding the effective utilization of CSS variables with HSL colors.
- Adding and adjusting a background photo on an HTML page using CSS.
- Implementing media queries for responsive design within the project.

### Continued development

Lately, I've been working with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and ReactJS on some freelance projects. I'm also taking a ReactJS course on Udemy. ReactJS courses usually expect some knowledge of HTML and CSS beforehand, so I'm refreshing my memory on those and learning new things. I think it's a great idea to practice by taking on challenges on Frontend Mentor. My plan is to solve and share one challenge each week.

Next challenge will be [E-commerce product page](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/ecommerce-product-page-UPsZ9MJp6).
