## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS flex
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I would like to recap some of the key learnings from this project, which include:

- Using CSS flex to organize related elements on a webpage.
- Understanding what backdrop are and how to effectively use it in a file.
- Creating a hamburger menu.
- Implementing media queries for responsive design in the project.
- Using javascript to add some functionality to the nav menu to cover it with hamburger menu feature.

### Continued development

Recently, I have been studying HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and ReactJS. I am currently taking a ReactJS course on Udemy. Generally, ReactJS courses assume some prior knowledge of HTML and CSS. Therefore, I have been refreshing my knowledge of them and learning new features. I believe that applying this new knowledge in creating projects will help me grasp new features more easily. So, I think it's a brilliant idea to tackle new challenges on Frontend Mentor. My plan is to solve and share one challenge per week.

Next challenge will be [Results summary component](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/results-summary-component-CE_K6s0maV/hub).

## Acknowledgments

I have been taking a course from Udemy and it is called [Sıfırdan Projelerle Front-End ve React 18.x Öğren (52+Saat)](https://www.udemy.com/course/sifirdan-projelerle-javascript-ve-react-ogren). The course is presented by Hakan Yalcinkaya and is useful for learning the fundamentals of becoming a frontend developer. My primary goal is to gain more knowledge about ReactJS. However, it will be beneficial to refresh my understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript by following this course.
