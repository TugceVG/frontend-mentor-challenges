## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS flex
- Exploring Color Schemes
- Mobile-first workflow
- Vanilla JS

### What I learned

I would like to recap some of the key learnings from this project, which include:

- Using CSS flex to organize related elements on a webpage.
- Understanding how to effectively use CSS variables with HSL colors.
- Creating DOM Elements with JavaScript.
- How to use .json file values in creating DOM elements with JavaScript.
- Implementing media queries for responsive design in the project.

### Continued development

Recently, I have been studying HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and ReactJS. I am currently taking a ReactJS course on Udemy. Generally, ReactJS courses assume some prior knowledge of HTML and CSS. Therefore, I have been refreshing my knowledge of them and learning new features. I believe that applying this new knowledge in creating projects will help me grasp new features more easily. So, I think it's a brilliant idea to tackle new challenges on Frontend Mentor. My plan is to solve and share one challenge per week.

Next challenge will be [Base Apparel coming soon page](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/base-apparel-coming-soon-page-5d46b47f8db8a7063f9331a0).
